CrystalGenomeLAMMPSExample
==========================

Example usage of the `kim-tools <https://kim-tools.readthedocs.io>`_ package to make a Crystal Genome Test Driver. This Test Driver computes the energy vs. volume of an arbitrary crystal under isotropic contraction and expansion.

As with any Crystal Genome Test Driver written using `kim-tools <https://kim-tools.readthedocs.io>`_, this Test Driver can be run directly. See how to do so here: 
https://kim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/CrystalGenomeASEExample__TD_000000654321_000/run.html (in fact, this is a rendered version of the ``run.py`` script found in this repo).
